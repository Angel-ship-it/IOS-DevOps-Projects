# IOS-DevOps-Projects
This is all the apps that I built in IOS
I began with creating a recipe app that I improved upon as  I learned more about View Models and Data Models.

The MoviesAPI app Was for me to learn how to pull from APIs.


For my final project, I learned Spotify's SDK to create an app for Duke Students. 
This App plays a curated playlist specific to a campus location. So if at the library the app will play a study music playlist and, if at the gym the app will play a workout playlist.
